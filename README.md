# static_frames
Jupyter tool for 1st year structural engineering and programming teaching at Cambridge University.

This Jupyter notebook was created as part of the 2020 revamp to improve student safety in coronavirus season and also to make the lab generally more fun to do. The intention is to partially replace [the previous lab guide which is nearly 20 years old](http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/mmg/teaching/statics/index.html).

All instructions are given inline on [Statics_lab.ipynb](https://github.com/deryckchan/static_frames/blob/main/Statics_lab.ipynb). All mistakes mine. --Deryck Chan 2020
